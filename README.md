# Hi there 👋, I'm Anushka Khara! 📊📈

### About Me

I believe that behind every beautiful composition lies mathematical precision, and I'm dedicated to crafting quantitative solutions that make financial sense. My curiosity about human behavior 🤔 and financial challenges has led me to a career in investment banking 🏦, where I can apply my analytical skills to real-world problems.

I am a Master of Arts in Applied Quantitative Finance student at Madras School of Economics and hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics from Calcutta University 🎓.
